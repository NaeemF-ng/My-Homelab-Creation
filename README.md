# My-Homelab-Creation

#Overview: 
This repository will cover everything I downloaded to create my homelab in order to practice getting hands on experience in the field of Cybersecurity, most importantly in a safe environment.

#Prerequisites

VirtualBox Installation: I installed virtualbox which is an open source vitualization software that allows you to create and run virtual machines (VMs) on your physical computer. A virtual machine is an emulation of a computer system, allowing you to run multiple operating systems (OS) on a single physical machine simultaneously.

Kali Linux VM Installation: I followed a youtube video that explained how to download the kali packaging from kali.com to configure and create the kali VM. This included things such as how much RAM should be allocated to the VM and things of that nature.

Ubuntu VM Installation: I installed a Ubuntu virtual machine following a youtube walkthrough which was intended to be my target while I used Kali Linux as my main. 

Metasploitable VM Installation: I installed the metasploitable which was a better VM as it provided many more vulnerabilities to give me versatility when it came to gaining access to it.

As a heads up, this is everything I have in my homelab as of right now. However, I will be including more VM's and additions throughout the course of my journey.
